# OBJECT LITERALLY
x = 1      # 1 is literally the integer 1
y = "foo"  # "foo" is literally the string "foo"
["a", "b"] # this is literally an array with "a" and "b"

# Those are literal ways to reference to an instance of their class

1 # is an Integer
"foo" # is a String, etc...

# Integer and String are CLASSES
